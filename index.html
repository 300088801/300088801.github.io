            <h2>Who Am I</h2>
            <img src="img/bioPic.jfif" alt="A Picture of Erich">
            <p>My name is Erich Osterman and I am currently working towards my associates degree in software development. I grew up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and stayed there until college. I attended Martin Luther College in Minnesota where I played baseball and soccer all four years. During this time, I was set up on a blind date by the womens soccer captains which is how I met my wife. After graduating from college, we decided to move to China where we taught at Zhongnan Minzu Dashua, a university for the different ethnic groups that make up China. While there we ate alot of great food and travelled everywhere in Southeast Asia. Because of Covid, we were forced back to the US and found ourselves in New London, Wisconsin where my wife taught 4th grade. During that time, I became interested in going back to school for something in the IT field. After a few years, I finally decided to do it and that is where I am today. </p>
